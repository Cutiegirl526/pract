			  	<h4><b>Why I took this class</b></h4>
			  		<p>
			  		I took this class so that I can expand my knowledge in coding. I am planing to be in the computer engineering field and hopefully work here for live action. I learned a bit of coding from LiveAction and they gave me a website where I can practice coding and learn different types or "language" in coding.

				<h4><b>UX vs UI</b></h4>

				<p>
					I expect this class to be hard. Though I also expect this class to be fun and be entertaining. I know that there will be high standards and I also know that I will struggle here and there but times, I'll understand it if I practice. I also believe that we have high expectations to do because we have many projects to fill out on our own and we also have to represnt our school since it is the first year we are actually doing this class as an elective.

	  			<h4>How I Structured A Web Applicatioon in HTML</h4>

	  			<p>
	  				Using the HTML structure, I was able to create a site. I also learned that I can place certain items into a "container" thus creating boxes around the texts I want and how to section it off. To look at our websites, we actually use python version in which it is similar to the terminal but connects us to the site and we ca0n look at it and always change our site if anything. Although I have to be aware of the structure and to be sure I closed everything off, it is a very "cautious" thing to do becasue if I miss one step then it will be hard to find.
	  			</p>

	  			<p>
	  				I love the fact that I'm learning so much but it is hard to grasp around because then I don't know I'm learning things until I take the time to look at what I'm working with and I actually know what I am doing. It goes by too fast and there isn't much I can grasp onto in that moment and not be able to help anyone but when I am alone doing it with another class or following along on a websit, I know how to do it because of the things I learn and get taught.

	  			<p>
	  				Creating a site that is like an app was cool to do. I also just tried to go along but it kind confused me and going to fast was just alright though there wasn't much I did in class but I tried to follow the most I can for the most part of the class and trying to understand anything else. When doing games, there's obviously the app on the phones and there is always a website. The website part is a lot to move around and set it how you would want to set it because there's different parts for you to set the site to how you imagine it.

	  			<h4>Responsive Web</h4>

	  			<p>
	  				Trying a design with a site where it's able to change out the size of the index and all, was fun. It was a bit more simple in the index file but a bit more complicated in the css file. It's where you have to change the size of screen depending on how the site is and how there isdiffernt color and etc.

	  			<p>
	  				I kinda learned some of the other things of Java and this class added more to the previous things I had before. I also learned how it is similar but different to the HTML site and structure.

	  			<p>
	  				We did the conditioning for if it was true or false and I also learned they if it is false then nothing will show up and I also learned that if the statement is true, it'll give you something called a "console log" in which it would have to do what it says. So if I say three different statement and one is true then the program will work and show up.

	  			<b>Problem</b>
	  			<p>
	  				The problem we wanted to solve was that people was procrastinating on work. We noticed people stalling time when their reminder app goes off.
	  			</p>
	  			<b>Solution</b>
	  			<p>
	  				Our app uses creates an eye cating interface using emojies. We noticed people using many emojies to commicate with other people.
	  			</p>
	  			<b>Improving Video</b>
	  			<p>
	  				We would improve on our video by talking louder or recording in a not so loud room.
	  			</p>
	  			<b>Features</b>
	  			<p>
	  				Our current features involves emojies, reward points, and so much more. 
	  			</p>
	  			<b>Features would like to have</b>
	  			<p>
	  				We would like to add like a little area where users are able to unlock new emojies and have fun with the app.
	  			</p>
	  			<b>Challenges</b>
	  			<p>
	  				Some challenges our team faced was schedule wise. We couldn't find a right time and day to meet together witout having to wory about a plan interfering it.
	  			</p>
	  			<b>Anything different next time</b>
	  			<p>
	  				I don't know what I could do differently besides try to explain the app a little more than it is said.

	  			<h4>First Semester of Coding with DevLeague</h4>

	  			<p>
	  				Learning things with Devleague is fun. The first semester was full of suprises and so much more. We were taught things we thought was difficult but we also learned to get out of comfort zone. The emotions running everywhere for the first two quarter was unexplainable. The fact that Mr. Tan left, Miss Natalie taking over his spot, us students becoming a teacher assistance for Devleague and now dealing with registration is a lot to handle. I managed to get through most of it but not registration. I guess the fact this was stressful, I found it fun as well and I know it'll help me with my own career if I try hard enough and set my mind to it.
